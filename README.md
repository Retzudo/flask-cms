Flask CMS
=========

A mix between a static site generator and a CMS. The general site layout and
design is made with code. Editing text is only possible in fixed placed but
assisted with WYSIWYG. This system is meant for websites that rarely need only
minor updates which need to be made by untrained people.

Why?
----

Generally CMSs are too bloated for small sites that rarely change and static site
generators are not designed for end users in mind because you need to know how
to use the command line.
